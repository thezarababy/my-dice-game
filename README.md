# My dice game

This is a brief description of my dice game. whenever you refresh your web page, both(each named player 1 and player 2 respectively) dice changes to a random number from 1-6. If player 1 displays a number that is greater(>) than player 2, then the heading changes to 'player 1 wins!' and vice-versa. but if player 1 and player 2 displays equal(=) number, then the heading chnages to 'draw!'.
